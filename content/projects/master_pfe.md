### Abstract

Computer vision is a sub field of artificial intelligence (AI) that offers the computers

and systems the ability to extract meaningful information from digital images and videos,

this way computers can take decisions or perform actions based on that information.

Computers now can observe and see as if they have eyes.

Stereoscopy, also called stereo imaging, creates the illusion of three-dimensional depth

from given two-dimensional images. The human vision is a great example of stereoscopy,

the eyes perform a visual information gathering, they send this last one to the brain for

processing, the brain reconstructs the real 3D scene and concludes several information

from it.

Three-dimensional reconstruction is the process of obtaining a 3D representation of an

object or a scene starting from a collection of 2D images.

The goal of this work is to build a system that imitates the human visual system by

taking images for a given object and provides a 3D representation for this object.
