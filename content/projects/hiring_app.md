Jober is an Android app designed for tech professionals looking for employment. Users can create profiles, upload work experience and portfolios. Employers can search for candidates, view their profiles and contact them directly through the app. Employers can also post job offers, including job descriptions, work type (remote, in-office or hybrid) and office location on a map view. The app also provides a feature where users can share a link to their CV.

The Design is made by me (Figma project is available).

### Some technical information about the app:


- Dagger-Hilt for dependency injection.
- MVVM architecture.
- LivaData.
- Kotlin coroutines.
- RxJava.
- Navigation component.
- DataBinding.
- Firebase services (Authentication,Storage,Database).
- And More...
